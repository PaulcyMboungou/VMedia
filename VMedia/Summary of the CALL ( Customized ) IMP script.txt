*****************************************************

Home phone 911 Emergency has some important differences to note. 

Emergency vehicles will go to the home address that is listed on your account in case of an emergency call. 

If you are not at home, you must tell the 911 dispatch person where to go for the emergency.

Also, your home phone will not work if the internet is down, or your account has been cancelled.


If Home Phone and Porting in a Phone Number 
*****************************************************

•	We will send you the ‘Phone Number Port-In Form’ that you need to print, fill out, sign, and upload to your My Account along with copy of first page of a current phone bill that shows your phone number and your address. 

•	Porting process takes about 2 weeks after we have received above copy of your phone bill and the port-in document. 

•       Do not forget to upload your two documents as process takes two weeks from then. 

•	Do not cancel your current phone service as port-in process will cancel your phone service for you. 

•         Once porting completed, we will email you a confirmation and  you can then call your previous phone company just to confirm that your phone account has been cancelled.
